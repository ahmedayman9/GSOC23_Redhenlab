# Automatic detection and analysis of relationships between prosody and co-speech gesture

This is the repository for all the code that was created during the GSoC 2023 at Red Hen Lab for the project topic "Automatic detection and analysis of relationships between prosody and co-speech gesture.". The main aim of this project is to build an automatic TOBI annotation system.
Now, we did an Automatic prosody detection system for intonational phrase boundary.
