This is the repository for all the code that was created during the GSoC 2023 at Red Hen Lab [https://www.redhenlab.org/summer-of-code/red-hen-lab-gsoc-2023-projects] for the project topic "Automatic detection and analysis of relationships between prosody and co-speech gesture.". The main aim of this project is to build an automatic TOBI annotation system.
Now, we did an Automatic prosody detection system for intonational phrase boundary.
